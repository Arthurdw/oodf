# OODF

## What is it?

OODF is a file format designed to be more advanced and object oriented.
This means that there are variables which can be refferenced.

## Current stage

The project is currently still in the idea phase, which means that we're still designing the language usage and thinking out features which have to be in the language.

## Ideas?

Feel free to create a issue/discussion with your suggestion!
